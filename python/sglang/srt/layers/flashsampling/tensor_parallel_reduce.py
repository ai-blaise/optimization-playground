"""Symmetric-memory TP reduction (replaces NCCL all_gather).
Inspired from https://github.com/meta-pytorch/kraken

The kernel's output buffers (maxs, maxs_idx) are allocated in symmetric memory.
For the fan-out path, each rank's kernel writes its own per-tile winners into
every peer rank's buffer. After the kernel completes, a host-side barrier
ensures all remote writes are visible, then each rank reduces its local copy.

Requires: NVLink-connected GPUs, PyTorch >= 2.6, CUDA >= 12.4.
